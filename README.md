# 🏥 MedNex Enterprise – Hospital Management System

**MedNex Enterprise** is a production-grade Hospital Management System designed to support large healthcare organizations with secure, scalable, and role-based digital operations. The system focuses on managing patients, doctors, appointments, and medical records while ensuring data isolation, reliability, and usability across multiple hospital units.

The project follows an enterprise architecture using Java Spring Boot for the backend and a modern web framework for the frontend. It simulates real-world healthcare workflows such as patient admission, electronic medical records (EMR), scheduling, notifications, and analytics dashboards. The goal is to provide a unified yet logically separated platform for hospitals to efficiently manage clinical and administrative processes.

### 🚀 Core Features

* **Multi-Tenant Architecture:** Logical separation of hospital data to ensure secure and isolated access between different hospital units.
* **Role-Based Access Control:** Dynamic menus and permissions for Admin, Doctor, and Nurse based on authenticated user roles.
* **Electronic Medical Records (EMR):** Patient admission forms with structured and semi-structured medical data storage.
* **Appointment Scheduling System:** Doctor calendar with conflict detection to prevent double booking.
* **Notifications:** Automated appointment confirmations and reminders via email.
* **Analytics Dashboard:** Visual reports such as bed occupancy and appointment statistics.
* **Secure Data Export:** Encrypted export of patient history for compliance and auditing.

### 🛠️ Technology Stack

* **Backend:** Java 21, Spring Boot, Spring Security, Hibernate
* **Frontend:** Angular (TypeScript)
* **Database:** PostgreSQL (JSONB support for medical records)
* **Security:** JWT-based authentication and role authorization
* **Utilities:** Mail service, charting libraries, PDF export
